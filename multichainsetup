Setting up MultiChain 

First install multichain for Windows 

Working with two shells(Local Servers 1 and 2)

FOR PRODUCTION BLOCKCHAINS WE WILL NEED TWO DIFFERENT SERVERS 
(MEANING TWO DIFFERENT COMPUTERS)

CREATING A BLOCKCHAIN  

1. First we will create a new blockchain named 
chain1.On the first server, run this command 

./multichain-util create chain1 

2. Initialize the blockchain, including 
creating the genesis block 

./multichaind chain1 -daemon 

You should be told that the server has started and then after 
a few seconds, that the genesis block was found.You should
also be given the node address that others can use to connect
to this blockchain 

CONNECTING TO A BLOCKCHAIN 
Now we will connect to this blockchain from elsewhere.On 
the second server (if working locally then you need to setup 
the data directory since in the same directory you cannot connect 
to the multichain on same server) 

In the multichain-windows directory 
create a data directory (any name ) say multichain-other 

mkdir multichain-other 

We need to connect using this command to the node address 
that we got 

IMPORTANT TO SEE (LOCAL SETUP)

./multichaind -datadir=multichain-other -port=10255 -rpcport=10254 chain1@<node_address_goes_here>

You will see the usual message about needing connect permission 
so assign these via the regular node 

You may see an error cannot connect to the server but this is due to the fact that the daemon api 
is not running and you need to start it using the command  

In a new terminal (3rd terminal)

./multichaind chain1 -daemon 

MULTICHAIN TEAM ANSWER 
It sounds like the multichaind daemon is no longer running, since this is a message given by 
multichain-cli when it does receive a response from the daemon's API. In Windows you need to run 
the daemon and the command-line in two separate windows, since the daemon can't run in the background.

And then you can grant permissions from regular node to other nodes that are trying to connect to the blockchain 
using this command in the regular terminal(1st server/1st terminal)

Granting connect, receive and send permissions to the 2nd node (2nd server terminal - local in our case)

This command is to be run in the first server since it is the regular one that will grant permissions 
to all other nodes that are trying to connect to it. 

./multichain-cli chain1 grant <wallet_address_goes_here> connect, send, receive 

Now you can start up the second node again 

./multichaind -datadir=multichain-other -port=10255 -rpcport=10254 chaintest -daemon

You can send commands to the second node as follows 
This command is to be run from the regular terminal (1st server 
terminal)

./multichain-cli -datadir=multichain-other -rpcport=10254 chaintest


MULTICHAIN IN INTERACTIVE MODE 

On both the servers (terminals here we are working locally)

./multichain-cli chain1 

Now that the blockchain is working on two nodes you can run the commands in this section 
on either or both. To get the general information 

getinfo

See a list of all available commands:

help

Show all permissions currently assigned:

listpermissions

Create a new address in the wallet:

getnewaddress

List all addresses in the wallet:

getaddresses

Get the parameters of this blockchain (based on params.dat file):

getblockchainparams

For each node, get a list of connected peers:

getpeerinfo

NATIVE ASSETS 

Now we are going to create a new asset and send it between nodes 
On the first server, get the address that has the permission 
to create assets (FIRST TERMINAL)

./multichain-cli chain1 listpermissions issue 

Above command will list the address that has the permission to create 
the assets 
(This will tell us which node has permission to CREATE AN ASSET 
and for this node we will be making use of its node address 
to create a new asset
Gives us the <node_address_which_has_permissions_to_create>)

CREATING A NEW ASSET 

Now weâ€™ll create a new asset on this node with 1000 units, each of which can be subdivided
into 100 parts, sending it to itself
To create a new asset execute the following:

On the first terminal  

./multichain-cli chain1 issue <node_address_which_has_permissions_to_create> asset1 1000 0.01

Above command will issue asset1 to the specified address

VERIFYING THE ASSET 

On both the servers verify that the asset named asset1 
is listed: 

listassets 

The asset can be seen in both the servers (
    running the command on both the terminals 
    ./multichain-cli chain1 listassets
)


CHECKING ASSET BALANCES 
Now check the asset balances on each server.The first should 
show a balance of 1000  and the second should show no assets at 
all 

For this run the command on both the server terminals 

./multichain-cli chain1 gettotalbalances 


SENDING THE ASSET  

On the first server, now try sending 100 units of the asset 
to the second server's wallet 
To send the units, execute the following command 

On the first terminal type 

./multichain-cli sendasset <second_server_wallet_address> asset1 100
